# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1:
import math function 
### Step 2:
Assign the value of point 1 and 2 whose distance is to be calculated 
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.jpg)
### Step 4:
print the coding to go the answer 
### Step 5:
End the program 
### PROGRAM:
 ```

import math
x=[10,6]
y=[4,2]
value=math.sqrt(((x[0]-y[0])**2)+((x[1]-y[1])**2))
print("{:.2f}".format(value))

``` 


### OUTPUT:
